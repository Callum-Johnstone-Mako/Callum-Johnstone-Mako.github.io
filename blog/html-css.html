      Sometimes we want to make our website look pretty by 
      <span class="inline">highlighting</span>
      certain parts of text in a <span class="inline">sentence</span> 
      as shown here. This is done by using the <b>"display inline"</b> 
      In your CSS file. An example of this in actioan and the 
      code used on this website looks like this.

      <P><img src="Pictures\Inline.png" alt="Inline Picture" ></P>
      </div>
