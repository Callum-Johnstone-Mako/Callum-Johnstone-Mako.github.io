    <h1>What's Does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h1>
   
  </div>
    <div class="List-Div">
   
      <P>
      Sometimes we want to make our website look pretty by 
      <span class="inline">highlighting</span>
      certain parts of text in a <span class="inline">sentence</span> 
      as shown here. This is done by using the <b>"display inline"</b> 
      In your CSS file. An example of this in actioan and the 
      code used on this website looks like this.
      </P>

    </div>
   
      <img class="'img2" src="\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-20.04\home\callum\devacademy\Callum-Johnstone-Mako.github.io\Pictures\Inline.png" alt="Inline Picture"> 
    
      <div class="List-Div">

<p>So lets break down whats going on in these screenshots shall we. The image on the left is the class created in the css file which determines four things here:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>padding</b>: The amount of space between the outside of the box and the text insude.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>border</b>: The traits of the border including what type how thick and the color 
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>background color</b>: Determines the background color of the highlighted section in this case its <span class="inline">Yellow<span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>display</b>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
