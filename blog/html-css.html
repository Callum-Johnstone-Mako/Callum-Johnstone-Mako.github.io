      <P>
      Sometimes we want to make our website look pretty by 
      <span class="inline">highlighting</span>
      certain parts of text in a <span class="inline">sentence</span> 
      as shown here. This is done by using the <b>"display inline"</b> 
      In your CSS file. An example of this in actioan and the 
      code used on this website looks like this.
      </P>

    </div>
   <div>
      <img class="'img2" src="\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-20.04\home\callum\devacademy\Callum-Johnstone-Mako.github.io\Pictures\Inline.png" alt="Inline Picture"> 
    </div>

      <div class="blog-Div">

<p>So lets break down whats going on in these screenshots shall we. The image on the left is the class created in the css file which determines four things here:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Padding</b>: The amount of space between the outside of the box and the text insude.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Border</b>: The traits of the border including what type how thick and the color 
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Background color</b>: Determines the background color of the highlighted section in this case its <span class="inline">Yellow<span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Display</b>: Determines how the highlighted section will be displayed in this case we used inline. 
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  The image on the right is in our html file and is how we use the code in action. The important part here is 
  the line < span > class="inline">highlighting < /span >
This will use the class "inline" created in the css file to apply to the text highlighting. The constraints of using inline to highlight 
text is that we are unable to set the dimensions of the section to be any bigger or smaller based on our needs.
If we want to determine the <span class="inline-block-width">width</span> and  <span class="inline-block-height">height</span> of 
the box we can use inline-block as shown below.

      </div>

      <div>
   
        <img class="'img2" src="\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-20.04\home\callum\devacademy\Callum-Johnstone-Mako.github.io\Pictures\Inline-block.png" alt="Inline Picture"> 
  
      </div>


  <div class="blog-Div">
  <p>
    <p>
      The code used to make these cyan highlighted sections are almost identical to display inline 
      with one key difference being that there are now width and height paramaters that can be set.
      Another use for inline-block is to display lists horizontally reather than vertically as inline block does not create
      a line braek after use. This trait has been used to display the footer of this webpage. The code used will be displayed and explained below.
