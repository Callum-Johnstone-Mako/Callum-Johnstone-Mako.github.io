        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <P>
         Emotional Intelligence also know as "EQ" or "EI" refers to the ability to 
         understand and control our emotions better aswell as the emotions of others.
         Emotional Intelligence is a skill that can be improved through reflecting and incresing
         ones empathy. Taking the time to listen and understand others emotions is an important
         part of your Emotional Intelligence. Emotional Intelligence can be measured by 
         either two types of tests.
         <P></P>
         <li><b>Self-Report Tests: </b>These are the most common as they are easy to
        administer and score. These tests require the users to answer questions that will
        rate thier own behaviours. </li>
         <li><b>Ability Tests: </b>Ability Tests are harder to administer and therefore 
        less used but can also provide a accurate measure of ones EQ. A ability test will
      have participants involved in different situations and have their responses/actions
    rated by a profesional 3rd party.</li>

      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <P>
       The key difference btween EQ and IQ is that our Emotional Intelligence measures 
       our ability to recognze our emotions and the emotions of others. It also measures
       our awareness to make good decisions based on those emotions. IQ however measures our
       ability to solve problems, use logic and our ability to understand complex ideas.

      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <P>
       Our EQ plays an important part in our lives and having a high level of emotional Intelligence 
       will help improve them in various areas. EQ can imrpove our ability to build relationships and reduce
       the stress that can come from them. Being able to understand our co workers emotions and feelings
       can also improve our wrokplace and productivity as solving issues and defusing conflicts will become 
       easier with a high EQ. Without the ability to understand and control our emotions with
       a high EQ we can become more susceptible to poor mental states and can result in
       depression and anxiety.
