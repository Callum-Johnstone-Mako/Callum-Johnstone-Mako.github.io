          <b>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</b> 
          <p></p>
          <ul>1. I used to think I had a positive mindstate when it came to learning new things
            But as I researched more about growth and fixed mindests I realised I fell into a fixed mindest.
          </ul>
          <ul>2. Writing about myself is quite hard and sharing things doesnt come easily to me.</ul>
          <ul>3. That my personality type is the one that is least likely to ask for help.</ul>
         </li>

          <b>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</b> 
          <p></p>
          Having a good understanding of these topics is important when working or learning with others. 
          Having high emotional intelligence and a good sense of empathy can have great impacts on 
          our productivity and ability to learn.

          <b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b> 
          <p></p>
          the core learning was surprising to me. I thought the ratio of core to tech would be different
          and I did not exapect as much focus on core skills as we have had. I also thought the Core
          learning was more interesting than i thought it would be in the beginning.
         </li>

          <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b> 
          <p></p>
         The hardest parts of the core learning through foundations has been sharing things about myself
         and being able to put my thoughts and ideas into readable blog posts.
         </li>
         <p></p>
         <li>
          <b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</b> 
          <p></p>
          Being an amazing programmer is not the only thing a company wants in an employee. A company wants
          someone who can work well in a team and can be able to learn new things quickly.
         </li>

         <li>
          <b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b> 
          <p></p>
          For me personally I enjoyed learning about the core aspects we have focussed on. However
          I didnt enjoy writing these blog posts as much simply because I spent far to long trying to answer
          the questions and this time could have been spent increasing my programming. I know 
          its important to understand these and its a skill/helful to be able to convey the knowledge to some else 
          to cement the ideas.
