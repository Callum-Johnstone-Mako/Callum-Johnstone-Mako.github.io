          <b>Blocked on a simple problem.</b> - Recently I encountered a
          problem during a task to make a square visible on a webpage using a 
          function called makeVisible(). I thought my code made logical 
          sense and was frustrated as to why it wasnt working. I went and 
          found some of my classmates solutions and mine were ver similar
          which made me more confused. It turns out my problem was a simple spelling
          mistake of "visable" which taught me to sometimes slow down and read
          through my code carefully for mistakes to avoid headaches.

          <b>Elegantly solved a problem.</b> - A problem I Recently solved was when
          writing a function to remove the word "Buzz" from a sentence. The sentence was 
          turned into an Array and each word became its own element in this array. So removing the 
          word buzz was the easy part but it would leave behind a empty spot in the array which was
          causing problems. I didnt know how to remove elements from certain postions in Arrays 
          so I went a researched for a method to help me. I was feeling inspired by doing this 
          rather than stright away throw in the towel and ask someone to help me. I eventually found
          the .splice method which solved my issue with ease and I was able to learn its uses for the future.

    <h2>Problem-Solving Techniques and Processes</h2>
    <P>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Pseudocode -</b> I think using Pseudocode even before you start coding will be
      effective in elimitating problems before they arise. I also think it will be useful 
      once a problem is found to help break it into doable parts.</li>  
      <li><b>Trying something -</b> This way of solving a problem is unfortuantly my 
        go to for solving problems and if I'm not careful can end up sucking up alot of time.
        I think this is effective to a point but attempts at trying different things need to be
        monitered before moving onto other techniques.</li> 
      <li><b>Rubber ducky method -</b> I'm still not super confident with this technique as
        I'm still learning myself and feel like I still dont understand alot of what I'm reading 
        or trying to accomplish. I think in the future once my skills develop this will prove
        to be a useful technique however.</li> 
      <li><b>Reading error messages -</b> I find these error methods helpful for locating 
        where in my code the problem is. This method provides lots of useful infomation that can not be found 
      online.</li>
      <li><b>Console.logging -</b> I enjoy using console.log to keep ttrack of what is 
      happening to certain variables and elements when my code is running.</li> 
      <li><b>Googling -</b> My favourite way to solve problems! Theres so much info online to
      help us with our issues. Whenever I go searching for my solution I usually learn a few
      new things along the way.</li>  
      <li><b>Asking your peers for help -</b> I prefer solving problems myself unfortuantly
      so this is usually a last resort and is helpful to get a seccond opinion on issues.</li> 
      <li><b>Asking coaches for help -</b> Similar to asking my peers for help, I like trying
      my hardest to figure out the issues I am having without having to ask for help. I'm 
      not above or have an issue with it however.</li> 
      <li><b>Improving your process with reflection - </b> I find reflecting on my work and
      and problem solving to be quite poor and something I'm not used to doing. I see how this will
      be a valuable way to ingrain techniques to solve problems faster.</li>
