          <b>Blocked on a simple problem.</b> - Recently I encountered a
          problem during a task to make a square visible on a webpage using a 
          function called makeVisible(). I thought my code made logical 
          sense and was frustrated as to why it wasnt working. I went and 
          found some of my classmates solutions and mine were ver similar
          which made me more confused. It turns out my problem was a simple spelling
          mistake of "visable" which taught me to sometimes slow down and read
          through my code carefully for mistakes to avoid headaches.

          <b>Elegantly solved a problem.</b> - A problem I Recently solved was when
          writing a function to remove the word "Buzz" from a sentence. The sentence was 
          turned into an Array and each word became its own element in this array. So removing the 
          word buzz was the easy part but it would leave behind a empty spot in the array which was
          causing problems. I didnt know how to remove elements from certain postions in Arrays 
          so I went a researched for a method to help me. I was feeling inspired by doing this 
          rather than stright away throw in the towel and ask someone to help me. I eventually found
          the .splice method which solved my issue with ease and I was able to learn its uses for the future.

      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <P>
       The key difference btween EQ and IQ is that our Emotional Intelligence measures 
       our ability to recognze our emotions and the emotions of others. It also measures
       our awareness to make good decisions based on those emotions. IQ however measures our
       ability to solve problems, use logic and our ability to understand complex ideas.

      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <P>
       Our EQ plays an important part in our lives and having a high level of emotional Intelligence 
       will help improve them in various areas. EQ can imrpove our ability to build relationships and reduce
       the stress that can come from them. Being able to understand our co workers emotions and feelings
       can also improve our wrokplace and productivity as solving issues and defusing conflicts will become 
       easier with a high EQ. Without the ability to understand and control our emotions with
       a high EQ we can become more susceptible to poor mental states and can result in
       depression and anxiety.
