      <P>
      To create a functional website you need three key elements:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>HTML</b>: The structure or skeleton of the webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CSS</b>: The stlying of the webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Jsvascript</b>: The functionality of the webpage.
        </li>
        
      </ol>

      A common analogy to understand these three components is to think of them as a building
      instead: 
      <P></P>
      <li>
        <b>HTML</b>: The framing of the building including how many rooms, windows, doors etc. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>CSS</b>: How the building can be designed using different paints and carpets and such.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Javascript</b>: What can be done in the building. We could cook a meal, 
        watch tv or sleep in a bed.  
      </li> 

      </P>

      <h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
      <p>
        <li>
          <b>Control Flow</b>: In Javascript control flow relates to how your computer
          runs code. Your computer will run the code provided from the top line to
          the bottem unless a statement changes the control flow such as loops.
        </li> 
        <li>
          <b>Loops</b>: A loop is a section of code that will repeat based on a certain condition.
          This loop will continue until the condition set is no longer true and be exited and 
          the code will continue from top to bottom control flow again. Check out the example below for help.
        </li>
      </p>

    </div>

  <div class="blog-Div">
  
    <p>
    In the picture above we have an example of a loop know as a for loop.
    From top to bottem we first create a variable "let Toalplants = 10". This is use
    to determine how many times through the loop we wish to go. The way the loop works
    is by first creating a new variable "i = 0". This acts as a counter and will increase
    every time the loop cycles through using the "i++". The part in between these to
    is the condition that needs to be true before the loop is broken "i <= TotalPlants" 
    So aslong as "i" is less than or equal to "TotalPlants" the loop will continue and
    and perform the function Waterplant().

  <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
  <p>
    The DOM stands for "Doccument Object Model" and is model of the webpage
    constructed as a tree of Objects.
