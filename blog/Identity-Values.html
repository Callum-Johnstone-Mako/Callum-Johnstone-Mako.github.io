        <h2>Core personal values</h2>
        <P>
          <ul>
      <li><b>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision 
        to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that 
        decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</b>
        </li>
       
        <li>
           An ethical decision I had to make happend a couple of years ago 
           when the lady sitting on the bus infront of me left were laptop behind 
           on the bus. 
           <p></p>
           The choice I had to make was whether to:
           
           <ol>
             <li> Do nothing and leave it on the bus. </li>
             <li> Hand the laptop into the bus driver and hope he can find the owner. </li>
             <li> Take the laptop with me and track down the owner myself. </li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        I chose option three and took the laptop with me and find the owner myself. I came to this 
        decision because if the situation was reversed I would have wanted the same thing to happen to me. 
        Treting people the way you want to be treated is a core value I hold. I ended up finding th eowner from the username
        on facebook and returned the laptop to a relieved first year student.

          <li>
           <b>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</b> 
          
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Coming from a western culture my identity has been influenced by the society I live in. 
            The Value/Identity most influenced would be my individualistic approach to most things 
          in my life. Asking for help is not something that comes easy to me and I like to solve any problems I'm having myself.

    <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
    <P>
      <ul>
  <li>
    <b>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of
       your learning and career development</b>
    </li>
   
    <li>
      I think my greatest strength when learning is my problem solving skills, I enjoy a challenge 
      and coming up with a solution is extremely satisfing. A weakness I have that can affect 
      my learning and career is that I can struggle to ask for help. I enjoy learning in a very hands on 
      approach as opposed to the traditional listening and taking notes format of schools and universities. 
      This means I can struggle or thrive depending on the learning situation. 


    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
      <b> Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they 
        intersect with learning obstacles.</b>
      </li>
     As explained above I think my problem solving skills will be critical throughout this course 
     but can also lead to road blocks when I dont ask for help when I cant find the solution myself.
      <li>
        
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        <b>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work 
        productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss 
        the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your 
        reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</b>
        </li>

          While studying at Weltec I was paired up with another member of the class for a group project.
          However my partner was struggling a bit with the course and wasnt up to speed with a lot of things. There
          was some tension at first but I tried my best to help him catch up rather than get upset or angry.
          It was helpful to diffuse the tension and become more relxed but not so effective in our productivity. I wish I would have gone to our tutor and explained the situation that he was stuggling and
          it was affting our work.
