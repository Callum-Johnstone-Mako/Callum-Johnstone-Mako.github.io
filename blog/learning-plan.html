        <P>
          <ul>
      <li><b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b></li>
        
        <li> My long term plan is to build up my skills and knowledge to be able to work remotely
          so I can work anywhere in the world either as a employee or even as a contractor. I also
          want to enjoy my job and be continually challenged in my career so I dont become bored.

        <li><h2>Strengths</h2></li>
        
           <ol>
          <li>
           <b> Problem Solving </b>- I think my problem solving skills and thinking outside the box to find soltions
            is a key component to my larning.
            </li>
            <li>
           <b>Learning style </b>- I know that I learn better when doing something hands on rather than listening or watching something.
            this could also cause some limitations with my laering but I think knowing which I find better is beneficial. 
         </li>
         <li>
          <b>Working in groups </b>- I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve a goal. I find bouncing ideas off each other is 
          a great way to solve problems.
         </li>
        </ol>
        
        <li><h2>Limitations</h2></li>
        <ol>
          <li>
           <b>Getting Stuck</b>- Getting stuck and refusing or forgetting to ask for help is a problem need to work on

            </li>
            <li>
           <b>Time management/routine building</b>- I have allways had issues with created plans while learning. I can sometimes leave things to the last minute before getting things done.
           I allways do get it done but they added stress of rushing things isnt healthy
           and I am working on getting a routine in place to help me. 
         </li>
         <li>
          <b>Easily distracted</b>- I find my mind can wander and come up with excuses for not working and procrastinating. 

         </li>

        <p></p>

        <li><b>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></li>
        
        <li>I'm very excited for this part of the course as I know there are aspects in my life that would benifit from 
          some improved human skills. Im quite a reserved person natrually and can find it difficult to 
          express myself to others in any enviroment wether it be freinds/family or workmates. I would 
          also like to overcome nerves during important interviews.
        </li>

        <li><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</b></li>
        
        <li>I have put myself in a position where I can fully commit to complete the neccasary 
          time needed for this course. I have a nice work enviroment and plenty support around me. 
          I am still working on a routine to help me better use my time and become more efficient.
          Im going to get out of my comfort zone and ask for help when needed rather than waste time on simple problems.
        </li>
